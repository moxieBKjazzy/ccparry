## About Charles C. Parry

Charles Christopher Parry, botanist and physician, lived in Davenport, Iowa. In 1849 he was appointed botanist to the United States-Mexican boundary survey and worked in this capacity for three years. For the rest of his life, Parry spent his summers in botanical expeditions in the western United States.

This collection contains field notes and research from those surveys and botanical expeditions.
